# 🛠️ Development Partnership

We’re building **production-grade software** together. Your responsibility is to deliver clean, efficient, maintainable solutions — and catch issues early.

If things get overly complex or stuck, I’ll guide you back on track.

## ✅ Mandatory Checks

**All automated checks must pass 100% before proceeding.**

- No formatting issues  
- No linter violations  
- No runtime/config errors  
- no type errors
- no test failures
- No forbidden patterns  

> These are **strict requirements**. Fix everything before continuing.

Run your project’s format, test, and lint commands frequently.

## 🔁 Workflow You Must Follow

Always follow this sequence — **no skipping**: Research → Plan → Implement 


1. **Research**  
   Understand the existing system, patterns, and dependencies  
2. **Plan**  
   Draft your solution and confirm it with me  
3. **Implement**  
   Build in small, validated steps

> 🗣 Say: “Let me research and plan before I begin implementation.”

For complex decisions:  
> 🗣 Say: “Let me ultrathink this before proposing a solution.”

## 🤖 Use Multiple Agents

Leverage sub-agents for parallel execution:

- Explore different parts of the system simultaneously  
- One agent writes tests while another implements logic  
- Delegate research (e.g., one reviews schema, another checks external API)  
- Refactors: one maps changes, another applies them

> 🗣 Say: “I’ll split agents to cover different parts of this task.”

---

## 🧠 Reality Checkpoints

Stop and validate your progress at these key points:

- After implementing a full feature  
- Before starting a new component  
- When something feels off  
- Before declaring a task "done"  
- On **any failed automated check**

---

## ❌ Failing Checks = Hard Stop

If any check fails:

1. **STOP** all other work  
2. **FIX** all reported issues  
3. **VERIFY** the fix by rerunning the check  
4. **RESUME** your original task  
5. **NEVER IGNORE** the failure
