## 📊 Confidence Score Reporting

**ALWAYS append a confidence score [0.0-1.0] to your responses**

### Format
End every response with: `[Confidence: X.X]`

### Score Guidelines
- **0.9-1.0**: Certain about the solution, have verified it works
- **0.7-0.8**: Fairly confident, standard pattern, but haven't fully tested
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate confidence, some uncertainty about approach
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence, multiple possible solutions, needs research
- **0.0-0.2**: Very uncertain, guessing, or lacking critical information

### When to Lower Confidence
- Missing context or files not yet read
- External dependencies not verified
- Complex logic without tests
- First time using a pattern/library
- Conflicting requirements
- Assumptions made without verification

### Examples
- "Fixed the API endpoint and verified it works" [Confidence: 0.9]
- "This should fix the issue based on the error message" [Confidence: 0.7]
- "I think this might work but need to test it" [Confidence: 0.5]
- "I'm not sure about this approach, let me research more" [Confidence: 0.3]

---

## ✅ Mandatory Checks

**All automated checks must pass 100% before proceeding.**

- No formatting issues  
- No linter violations  
- No runtime/config errors  
- no type errors
- no test failures
- No forbidden patterns  

> These are **strict requirements**. Fix everything before continuing.

Run your project’s format, test, and lint commands frequently.

## 🔁 Workflow You Must Follow

Always follow this sequence — **no skipping**: Research → Plan → Implement 


1. **Research**  
   Understand the existing system, patterns, and dependencies  
2. **Plan**  
   Draft your solution and confirm it with me  
3. **Implement**  
   Build in small, validated steps with periodic checkpoints

> 🗣 Say: "Let me research and plan before I begin implementation."

For complex decisions:  
> 🗣 Say: "Let me ultrathink this before proposing a solution."

### 📍 Implementation Checkpoints

**During implementation, periodically:**

1. **Run Existing Tests** (every 2-3 file changes)
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   ```
   > 🗣 Say: "Running tests... [✓ All tests pass] or [✗ X tests failing, fixing now]"

2. **Write New Tests** (for each new feature/function)
   - Write tests BEFORE or IMMEDIATELY AFTER implementation
   - Ensure coverage for happy path and edge cases
   - Run tests to verify they pass
   > 🗣 Say: "Added tests for [feature]. Coverage now at X%"

3. **Git Commit** (after each logical unit of work)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add user authentication logic"
   ```
   - Use present tense, imperative mood
   - One-line commits only
   - NO co-authors
   - Commit frequently (every 30-60 min of work)
   > 🗣 Say: "Committed: 'Add user authentication logic'"

### 🔄 Checkpoint Rhythm

**Mini-checkpoint every:**
- ✓ 2-3 files modified
- ✓ 1 feature completed
- ✓ 30 minutes of work
- ✓ Before switching context

**Full checkpoint includes:**
1. Run all tests
2. Fix any failures
3. Write missing tests
4. Commit changes
5. Report status

### 📊 Status Reporting Format

```
🔄 Checkpoint Update:
- ✅ Tests: 48/48 passing
- ✅ Type check: No errors
- ✅ Lint: Clean
- 📝 New tests: Added 5 tests for auth module
- 💾 Committed: "Add JWT token validation"
- 🎯 Next: Implement refresh token logic

[Confidence: 0.9]
```

## 📋 Spec-Driven Development (For Complex Features)

For substantial features or projects, use the spec-driven methodology with explicit approval gates:

### Phase Structure
1. **Planning** - Break down project into manageable features (`/x:spec:plan`)
   - Interactive conversation to identify features
   - Creates numbered feature directories (01-feature, 02-feature)
   
2. **Requirements** - Define WHAT using EARS format (`/x:spec:requirements [feature-name]`)
   - Interactive elicitation of functional/non-functional requirements
   - Produces EARS-formatted requirements.md
   
3. **Design** - Define HOW with technical specs (`/x:spec:design`)
   - Tech stack selection (Full-Stack JS, Python, Cloud-Native, Enterprise, Custom)
   - Creates comprehensive design.md with architecture
   
4. **Tasks** - Break into TDD steps (`/x:spec:tasks`)
   - Generates implementable tasks with Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Uses checkbox format for progress tracking
   
5. **Implementation** - Execute tasks with checkbox tracking (`/x:spec:execute`)
   - Choose approach: TDD, Standard, Self-implementation, or Collaborative
   - Updates checkboxes (✅) as work progresses

### EARS Requirements Format
Use these templates for clear, testable requirements:
- **Ubiquitous**: "The system SHALL [requirement]"
- **Event-Driven**: "WHEN [trigger] THEN the system SHALL [response]"
- **State-Driven**: "WHILE [state] the system SHALL [requirement]"
- **Conditional**: "IF [condition] THEN the system SHALL [requirement]"
- **Optional**: "WHERE [feature included] the system SHALL [requirement]"

### Requirements Best Practices
- Use active voice and "SHALL" for mandatory requirements
- Be specific and measurable (avoid "quickly", use "within 2 seconds")
- One requirement per statement
- Avoid ambiguous terms ("appropriate", "reasonable", "user-friendly")

### Approval Gates
Always request explicit approval before moving between phases:
> 🗣 Say: "Requirements complete. Ready for design phase?"
> 🗣 Say: "Design complete. Ready for task breakdown?"
> 🗣 Say: "Tasks defined. Ready to begin implementation?"

### File Structure
```
docx/
└── features/
    └── [NN-feature-name]/     # e.g., 01-user-auth, 02-payment
        ├── requirements.md    # EARS-formatted requirements
        ├── design.md         # Technical design document
        └── tasks.md          # Implementation breakdown
```

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

When implementing features, especially from spec-driven tasks, follow TDD methodology:

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **Red**: Write a failing test for next functionality
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Implementation Flow
1. Start with acceptance criteria from tasks as test scenarios
2. Write unit tests for components and functions
3. Write integration tests for APIs and data operations
4. Implement code incrementally to satisfy tests
5. Refactor continuously while maintaining green tests

### Benefits
- Requirements validation through executable tests
- Early design feedback and issue detection
- Built-in documentation through test scenarios
- Safe refactoring with comprehensive test coverage

> 🗣 Say: "Starting with TDD - writing failing test first."

---

## 🤖 Use Multiple Agents

Leverage sub-agents for parallel execution:

- Explore different parts of the system simultaneously  
- One agent writes tests while another implements logic  
- Delegate research (e.g., one reviews schema, another checks external API)  
- Refactors: one maps changes, another applies them

> 🗣 Say: “I’ll split agents to cover different parts of this task.”

---

## 🧠 Reality Checkpoints

Stop and validate your progress at these key points:

- After implementing a full feature  
- Before starting a new component  
- When something feels off  
- Before declaring a task "done"  
- On **any failed automated check**

---

## ❌ Failing Checks = Hard Stop

If any check fails:

1. **STOP** all other work  
2. **FIX** all reported issues  
3. **VERIFY** the fix by rerunning the check  
4. **RESUME** your original task  
5. **NEVER IGNORE** the failure

---

## 🤔 On Task Conflicts or Gaps

### When to Stop and Ask for Clarification

**IMMEDIATELY pause and ask when encountering:**

1. **Conflicting Requirements**
   - Multiple valid interpretations of the task
   - Requirements that contradict each other
   - Unclear acceptance criteria
   > 🗣 Say: "I found conflicting requirements: [explain conflict]. Which approach would you prefer?"

2. **Missing Critical Information**
   - Undefined business logic
   - Missing API documentation
   - Unclear data relationships
   - Unknown external dependencies
   > 🗣 Say: "I need clarification on [specific missing info] to proceed correctly."

3. **Multiple Valid Solutions**
   - Several architectures could work
   - Different libraries solve the same problem
   - Trade-offs between performance/simplicity/cost
   > 🗣 Say: "I see [X] possible approaches: [list them]. Each has trade-offs: [explain]. Which aligns best with your priorities?"

4. **Scope Ambiguity**
   - Feature boundaries unclear
   - "Nice to have" vs "must have" unclear
   - Edge cases not specified
   > 🗣 Say: "The scope isn't clear regarding [specific area]. Should I include [feature Y]?"

### How to Ask for Clarification

**Structure your questions to get actionable answers:**

```
❓ Current Understanding:
"Based on the requirements, I understand that [summary]..."

🤷 Uncertainty:
"However, I'm unclear about [specific points]..."

💡 Options:
"I see these possible approaches:
1. [Option A] - Pros: [...] Cons: [...]
2. [Option B] - Pros: [...] Cons: [...]"

🎯 Recommendation:
"I lean toward [option] because [reasoning], but need your input."

[Confidence: X.X]
```

### Red Flags That Require Immediate Clarification

**STOP immediately when you notice:**
- 🚨 Security implications not addressed
- 🚨 Data privacy requirements missing  
- 🚨 Performance requirements unspecified for data-heavy features
- 🚨 Integration points with unknown systems
- 🚨 Regulatory/compliance requirements unclear
- 🚨 Cost implications of external services

### Default Assumptions to AVOID

**Never assume:**
- ❌ "The user probably wants the simplest solution"
- ❌ "This edge case won't happen"
- ❌ "Performance doesn't matter for this feature"
- ❌ "We can add security later"
- ❌ "The user knows about this technical limitation"
- ❌ "This is similar to another project, so same rules apply"

### When NOT to Ask (Proceed with Best Practices)

**Use standard patterns without asking for:**
- ✅ Code formatting and style (follow existing patterns)
- ✅ Standard security practices (always implement)
- ✅ Error handling (always include comprehensive handling)
- ✅ Input validation (always validate)
- ✅ TypeScript types (always add proper types)
- ✅ Basic accessibility (always include)

> 🗣 Say: "I'll implement this following standard best practices for [security/performance/accessibility]."

## 📋 User Action Tasks (IMPORTANT)

**ALWAYS create User Action Tasks when you encounter:**
- Tasks requiring manual user intervention
- External service setup (API keys, accounts, credentials)
- Deployment or production configurations
- Tasks needing human approval or judgment
- External system access you cannot reach
- Manual verification steps
- One-time setup procedures

### When to Create User Action Tasks

**MUST create a User Action Task for:**
1. **Environment Variables**: When .env files need API keys or secrets
2. **External Services**: Setting up Supabase, Stripe, Auth providers, etc.
3. **Deployment**: Steps for Vercel, AWS, or other hosting platforms
4. **Manual Testing**: Steps requiring human verification
5. **Production Setup**: DNS, SSL, domain configuration
6. **Account Creation**: Any service requiring user registration
7. **Permission Grants**: OAuth apps, API access, etc.

### Format Requirements

1. **Location**: Save as `./docx/UserInstructions/[descriptive-name].md`
2. **Structure**:
   ```markdown
   # User Action Required: [Task Title]
   
   ## Overview
   [Brief description of what needs to be done and why]
   
   ## Prerequisites
   - [ ] List any required accounts or tools
   - [ ] Dependencies that must be in place first
   
   ## Steps
   
   ### 1. [First Major Step]
   [Detailed instructions]
   
   ```bash
   # Include any commands in code blocks
   npm install something
   ```
   
   ### 2. [Second Major Step]
   [More instructions with screenshots if helpful]
   
   ## Verification
   - [ ] How to verify the task was completed successfully
   - [ ] Expected outcomes
   
   ## Troubleshooting
   - Common issues and solutions
   ```

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Use checkbox lists for multi-step processes
   - Include exact commands in code blocks
   - Provide example values (but never real secrets)
   - Add verification steps
   - Include troubleshooting section

### Proactive Creation

**IMPORTANT**: Don't wait for the user to ask! When you encounter any task you cannot complete programmatically:

> 🗣 Say: "I've identified a task that requires your action. Let me create a User Action Task document for you."

Then immediately create the file with detailed instructions.

### Examples of User Action Tasks to Create

- "Set up Supabase project and obtain API keys"
- "Configure Vercel deployment with environment variables"
- "Enable Google OAuth and obtain client credentials"
- "Purchase and configure custom domain"
- "Set up Stripe account for payment processing"
- "Configure Cloudflare CDN settings"
- "Manual data migration steps"

## 🖥️ Command Execution Guidelines

### Before Running Any Command

**ALWAYS consider these requirements:**

1. **Logging Requirements**
   - If a command doesn't have built-in logging, redirect output to `./docx/logs/`
   - Create timestamped log files for debugging later
   - Example: `command > ./docx/logs/command-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log 2>&1`

2. **Long-Running Commands**
   - For commands that may run longer than 30 seconds, ALWAYS use PM2
   - PM2 provides better process management, logging, and monitoring
   - Examples:
     - Tests: `pm2 start npm --name "test-run" -- test`
     - E2E tests: `pm2 start npm --name "e2e-tests" -- run test:e2e`
     - Build: `pm2 start npm --name "build-process" -- run build`
   - View logs: `pm2 logs [process-name]`
   - Stop process: `pm2 stop [process-name]`
   - Delete process: `pm2 delete [process-name]`

3. **Server & Daemon Processes**
   - For HTTP servers, gRPC servers, daemon processes, or any persistent services
   - Always use process managers like PM2, forever, or systemd
   - Document the management commands in User Action Tasks
   - Examples:
     - Web server: `pm2 start npm --name "api-server" -- start`
     - Daemon/worker: `pm2 start worker.js --name "background-worker"`
     - Watcher: `pm2 start watcher.js --name "file-watcher" --watch`
     - One-time tasks (tests): `pm2 start npm --name "e2e-test-once" --no-autorestart -- run test:e2e`

4. **Interactive Commands**
   - If a command requires user input, STOP
   - Create a User Action Task with clear instructions
   - Tell the user: "This command requires manual input. Please run: [command]"
   - Never attempt to automate interactive prompts

### Command Execution Checklist

**Before executing any command:**
- [ ] Check if command outputs logs (if not, add logging)
- [ ] Estimate execution time (if >30s, run in background)
- [ ] Identify if it's a server process (use process manager)
- [ ] Verify if it needs user input (create User Action Task)

### Examples

**Good - With Logging:**
```bash
# Short command with logging (under 30s)
npm test > ./docx/logs/test-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log 2>&1

# Long-running commands with PM2 (over 30s)
pm2 start npm --name "e2e-tests" --no-autorestart -- run test:e2e
pm2 logs e2e-tests --lines 50 --nostream

# Build process with PM2
pm2 start npm --name "build-process" --no-autorestart -- run build
pm2 logs build-process --nostream

# View all PM2 processes
pm2 list

# Read logs without streaming (for completed processes)
pm2 logs [process-name] --nostream
```

**Good - Server Management:**
```bash
# Using PM2 for Node.js server (persistent process)
pm2 start npm --name "api-server" -- run start
pm2 logs api-server --lines 50

# Using PM2 for one-time tasks (no auto-restart)
pm2 start npm --name "test-run" --no-autorestart -- test
pm2 logs test-run --nostream

# Using screen for development server
screen -dmS dev-server npm run dev
echo "Dev server running in screen session 'dev-server'"
```

**Good - Handling Interactive Commands:**
> 🗣 Say: "The database setup requires interactive input. Please run the following command manually: `npm run db:setup`"

Then create `./docx/UserInstructions/database-setup.md` with detailed steps.
