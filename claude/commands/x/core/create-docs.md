# 🎯 TASK: Generate Foundational Documentation from Codebase

## 🧠 INTROSPECTION PHASE (MANDATORY)

Before writing, perform deep inspection of the current project to extract key information:

- 🔍 Detect high-level purpose, goals, architecture style, and naming conventions
- 🗂 Analyze code layout: root directory, internal modules, entrypoints
- 🔧 Identify tech stack: languages, frameworks, build tools, CI/CD
- 📚 Find any existing `README.md`, `*.env.example`, `Makefile`, `.github`, or config files
- 🧩 Look for usage of design patterns, layered architecture, or ADRs
- 🚨 Surface common "gotchas", startup pitfalls, or onboarding blockers

> Output MUST reflect extracted realities — no hallucinated tools or workflows.

## 📂 OUTPUT FILES
Write all documentation in one response, segmented by file:

- `docx/core/01-PRODUCT.md`
- `docx/core/02-TECH_STACK.md`
- `docx/core/03-CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`
- `docx/core/04-CRITICAL_KNOWLEDGE.md`

Use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) best practices:
- > Alert blockquotes for warnings/tips
- ```lang``` for syntax
- `- [ ]` task lists
- Markdown tables
- `mermaid` for diagrams

## 📌 RULES
- Never invent details — **extract or infer only from project**
- Write in active voice, with clarity for real-world teams
- Prioritize developer usability over documentation formality
